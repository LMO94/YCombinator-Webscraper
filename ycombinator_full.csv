Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).

0,FitFu,,2,"Ringwood, NJ",W11,New projects,"It all began in January 2009 when our founders - wandering digital sage Jof and software guru Benjie - released an innocent little app called PushupFu. The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.

And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.

Fitfu allows you to:

* Track your motion

Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.

* Celebrate progress with friends

Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.

* Discover a new way to stay motivated

The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.

* Stay active wherever, whenever

No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)

*Lose what you want

Participate with Fitfu at your level of interest - decide to be gung ho, middle of the road, or simply casual."
0,AppHarbor,,1,San Francisco,W11,.NET Cloud Platform as a Service,"AppHarbor is a .NET Platform-as-a-Service. Developers push code to AppHarbor using either Git or Mercurial. AppHarbor then builds the code and runs any unit tests. If everything checks out, the code is deployed to AppHarbor's scalable cloud platform.

AppHarbor lets developers spend their time coming up with ideas and developing applications, not patching servers, worrying about deployment, messing with configuration files, or scaling.

At AppHarbor, we believe that developing and deploying .NET application should be simple and fun. AppHarbor has been designed to tie in with developers day-to-day workflows. Deploying a new version to AppHarbor is as simple as checking in code when a new feature is ready.

AppHarbor will run most ASP.NET applications without modification. Moving an application to our platform requires no AppHarbor-specific code modifications nor installation of plugins or other custom software. We believe developers should be able to move applications and data to different cloud-vendors with as little friction as possible.

AppHarbor believes in giving developers access to an open ecosystem of addons and 3rd party services, not just the ones we decide to provide ourselves."

With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a ""mob"", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks.

Enter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.

0,Cheddar,,2,,S14,The Best Mobile Checking Account,"Ditch your bare-bones, high-fee checking account. You deserve free and powerful everyday banking.

Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.

It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.

Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.

What can be done? Bill Gates believes banks aren't necessary for banking. Millennials believe technology companies can make banking better. So let's build a better bank.

With the support of DARPA [2], we are building a team of computer scientists, and bioengineers to look at biology in fundamentally new ways.

Our current customers include industrial biotech firms that are leading the charge in transitioning us from traditional unsustainable means of manufacturing to sustainable biological processes leading to advanced fuels, materials, therapeutics, and flavors and fragrances. 20n’s technology helps them enter markets previously thought inaccessible for biology.

[1] Sequencing DNA costs $4k/genome (http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) and is expected to go down to $1k/genome. Synthesizing DNA is at 20cents/bp, and is expected to go down to 0.1cents/bp.

We don’t want to debate the death of print books, or the birth of ebooks, we love and support them all. 

A typical Publishing Team consists of an author, editor, designer and business/marketing manager for the book. You don’t get assigned projects in our system; you choose the people you work with.  We work much more quickly than traditional publishers, taking advantage of new technologies to streamline the process of getting books into the hands of readers.

Most businesses administer commissions with Excel and email, making it nearly impossible for sales reps or their managers to track how they are pacing throughout the month, let alone which transactions were included in a previous period’s paycheck. Compgun’s mission is to stand the status quo on it’s head by providing real-time performance tracking and insight to every member of the sales org."

In the process, we eliminate the toil associated with manual data entry.  This frees employees to focus on high value endeavors like relationship building and innovation.  

People.ai stands alone in our ability to harness business activity to unlock growth for our customers.  We’ve won 39 patents and have an additional 51 under review. We’ve also received validation via Gartner’s Hype Cycle for CRM Sales Technology 2019, inclusion in Forrester’s New Wave (expected publication Fall 2020), and rankings on the 2019 Y Combinator Top Companies List and the Forbes AI 50 list.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

Our ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet."

0,Oncobox,,11,"Walnut, CA",S17,Finding the right cancer drug for each patient.,"Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would be most effective in fighting individual patients’ specific cancers. That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with a variety of late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock, they don’t always know which drug will be most effective for their patients, and because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

At an estimated cost of $2,000 per patient, the Oncobox Integral Test analyzes DNA and RNA of over 2000 genes that are included in major molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases and finds the right drug for them. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

We are actively seeking partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. If you are in Oncobox for your patients, contact us at hello@oncobox.com.

We do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.

0,"Lucy Goods, Inc",2016,7,"Los Angeles, CA",W18,Lucy’s mission is to reduce tobacco-related harm to zero. We provide…,"If it isn’t bad enough that smokers don’t realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience — with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn’t carry around the sensation that they’re stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn’t to encourage nicotine use among people who haven’t started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn’t the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco — first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine’s pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA’s public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health — and reduce its costs — through a superior pure nicotine product."

The main perk of this model is that the customer doesn't need to compete for quality talent. Once you find the engineer that matches your criteria, there is no more need to worry that a competitor will beat your offer or your star freelancer will kiss you goodbye for a more lucrative gig. Your engineer is dedicated - which means 100% of their time is reserved for working on your project.

One thing YouTeam is adding to this, is that as a marketplace, we operate the talent dynamic availability data across the pool of 20,000+ engineers employed by several hundred vetted agencies in 19 countries. This allows to skip the recruitment phase entirely. All engineers are ready to start instantly and the customers usually have multiple candidates to choose from.

I created Spero (sperofoods.co) because I wanted everyone to be able to eat clean dairy alternatives that actually taste good. So, I leveraged my background in engineering, chemistry, and art to develop Spero's patent-pending formulations and brand.
 
At Spero, we make dairy from seeds. 
 
Why seeds? Almonds/cashews (nuts), which comprise the majority of the dairy alternatives industry today, will never create cost comparable products with dairy because they are too expensive and they're hard to scale. They take too much time, space, water, and human labor. Seeds are 7-8x less expensive and grow 50-70x faster than nuts.
 
Spero owns exclusive rights to the technology needed to transform seeds into dairy alternatives. Not only does our pending-patent cover novel processing techniques for cheeses, but it’s comprehensive for all dairy alternatives, including milk, creamers, yogurt, and even eggs.
 
By using truly scalable ingredients and cutting-edge technology, Spero will be the first company to make plant-based dairy cheaper than traditional dairy products. Spero will be the first company to make dairy alternatives mainstream.

The Challenge:
Current meat production is unsustainable and inefficient. It is a key driver of climate change, environmental degradation, and antibiotic-resistant disease. Yet these facts have not sparked significant behavior change: People are eating more meat than ever in the United States and
around the world.

GFI’s Solution:
We can create meat from plants or cultivate it directly from cells more sustainably and efficiently.
We will make more progress by changing the default choices than by trying to change every single person’s mind. GFI is accelerating the transition of the global food system to alternative
proteins by making them more delicious, affordable, and accessible than conventional animal products.

Our Programmatic Priorities:
SciTech: Bridging gaps in scientific research, funding, and talent across the alternative protein sector.
Corporate Engagement: Helping the food industry and investor communities put delicious, affordable alternative proteins on every menu and in every food retailer.
Policy: Advancing government investment in sustainable proteins as well as fair regulation and legislation.

GFI works around the world with team members based in the United States, Brazil, India, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Israel. We engage companies across the supply chain—from startups to legacy meat and food conglomerates, major chain restaurants, and retailers—as well as individual scientists, policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs."

PNOĒ is changing that with the first portable, low cost, and medical grade cardio-metabolic analyzer which comes with a data interpretation service, allowing anyone from a personal trainer to a cardiologist to apply cardio-metabolic analysis in his practice without the need for specialized skills. 

Our team has extensive experience in gas sensing technologies, cardio-metabolic analysis, nutrition and physical exercise prescription, cardiovascular & pulmonary disease diagnosis and hardware development (firmware, electrical engineering, mechanical design).  

We are on a mission to make cardio-metabolic analysis the health checkup of the future and we are excited to get in touch with anyone who believes he can help. Our initial approach was to start by making cardio-metabolic analysis accessible to the world of competitive fitness but very quickly saw great interest from the general population fitness and wellness market. As a result, our current focus is to offer cardio-metabolic analysis as a diet/physical exercise prescription as well cardiovascular/pulmonary disease prevention tool in fitness & wellness centers. In this direction, we are deploying PNOĒ in as many fitness & wellness centers as possible (i.e. gyms, boutique studios, private clinics, wellness retreats, corporate wellness centers etc.) so support through introductions and recommendations is highly appreciated. 

Areas of particular interest include: Health, wellness, fitness, wearables and gas sensing technologies."

Our first goal is therefore to  bring a novel non-hormonal, on-demand and low cost female contraceptive to the market that will substantially improve their quality of life and well-being. Our second goal is to develop the first ever non-surgical and highly effective non-hormonal contraceptive for men. Currently, male contraception is limited to two main options – vasectomy or condoms. Having such options available to both women and men will globally allow for much better family planning, reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies including abortions and therefore reduce costs and ensure contraceptive health and well-being."

That’s why we created Modoo. 

Mothers simply wear the device on their belly. It tracks baby’s heart rate, movements and generates baby’s health report, so we can consult a physician with just one click.

Modoo connects to an app that allows users to share data via social media sites like WeChat and Weibo, which makes it easy to help family and friends feel more connected.

And thanks to the information it collects, our users reported that, it has helped preventing the loss of 73 babies so far. 

We has been selling Modoo in China at price of 200 dollars since 2017. last year, we tripled our revenue to 3.4 million dollars. 

To target at a bigger market, we launched a subscription trial 3 months ago, with an initial price of 60 dollars. It’s growing 69% week on week, and already generating 50 thousand dollars in MRR. 

Pregnancy is a lucrative market. 16 million babies are born in China every year, that’s a $3.2 billion dollars home market. Worldwide 140 million births make a 28 billion dollars market.

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.

Our small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. 

Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.

Scientists have been measuring gene activity in our cells for over twenty years now, but it’s remained a mystery how diseases are able to turn certain genes on or off. Breast cancer, for example, is driven by 198 genes being activated when they shouldn’t be, and we don’t know why.

But that’s about to change. Just a few years ago, biologists discovered new molecules that turn genes on and off. Collectively, these molecules are known as the “epigenome,” and they’re the control switches that determine how our cells work and give rise to disease. 

At Arpeggio, we’ve developed a platform of biological and computational tools that make it possible to record changes in the epigenome over time and watch the results like a movie to see how drugs work. This gives scientists a clear understanding of how drugs and diseases function and has enabled our customers – including four of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world – to match the right treatments to the right patients, screen new compounds, and reposition existing drugs into new indications."

India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally ""bringing the gas stations to doorsteps"". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.

Do we have domain expertise in this area? 
Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.

How do you know people need what you're making? 
We have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts. Additionally, we have received over 400 franchisee requests across India where people want to offer mobile refueling service their town validating the demand."

Remember when your first Flipkart order arrived? You went through hundreds of products in their website, chose one that you liked, mostly cheaper than you could have gotten it in any offline shop (if it was available in an offline shop that is), and it shows up at your door. Remember that delight? There are 800 million Indians who are yet to experience that. So far, eCommerce in India has been only making inroads in the top income decile of the population. The price points for most products in eCommerce sites are largely out of bounds for the majority Indian population. There was no economically feasible way to sell low priced goods (think 200Rs shirt) to the rest of the population over internet. With WhatsApp and Facebook, group buying is just a click away. And because we can accumulate a large amount of orders for the same product this way, the prices go down significantly. Making it finally possible to sell a 200Rs shirt online and still have a positive unit economics. THIS is how we think eCommerce will be made accessible to majority of Indians.

This is how Pinduoduo democratized eCommerce for the less affluent in China.They are the fastest growing eCommerce company in the world, IPOing in a record three year time,They are already the second largest eCommerce player in China (launched only in 2015).

By removing Uber/Lyft’s 25% commission plus booking fee, Nomad drivers earn ~20% more, while riders pay ~20% less. Instead, Nomad monetizes through monthly driver subscriptions, in-car advertising, and in-car vending machines. One investor described us as the Salesforce of the Gig Economy where we sell software as a service (SaaS) to each driver. It’s the driver’s business, Nomad just sells them the software.

In our first 68 days of operation, Nomad has grown explosively. We have received over 9,450 ride requests from our 3,700+ users. We had over 1,000 ride requests in a single day as riders have grown obsessed with our service. Some of our top riders have requested 100+ rides since they have downloaded the app. We have coded the entire driver and rider apps ourselves and have reached the point where demand is far outstripping supply. We have thousands of paying, die-hard customers who tell us they love Nomad over Uber and Lyft. They say they feel safer and love our price point.

Volumetric is a recognized world leader in building living multicellular tissues, with a focus on replicating discrete functions of the human body for basic mechanistic biology, laboratory testing and screening, and drug development. Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.

Our Technology and Approach
We have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart."

Antibodies are a growing class of drugs that have tremendous safety and efficacy advantages over small molecules; 7 of the top 10 selling drugs are antibodies, earning an average of $7B in revenue. However, antibodies- especially ones that activate and modulate cell surface receptors- are hard to find. Abalone Bio expands the playing field for antibody therapeutics and enables us to previously access treatments for untreated diseases.

We have already discovered a novel antibody that activates a non-opioid receptor that produces analgesia. We are developing this antibody into a treatment for neuropathic pain – a medical condition that currently is treated with drugs like addictive opiates. The same molecule is also a potential treatment for inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, all 1B+ markets."

Tires are the perfect vertical to tackle first because they are future-proof (tires are going nowhere) and scale from luxury personal automobiles to freight-centric big-rigs. The current tire changing industry is entrenched with an aging workforce but maintains strong margins. We will build and deploy a robotic tire changing container that can change tires in 10 minutes. 

Our fully-integrated ROBOTIRE containers can be placed inside existing shops, Walmart parking lots or in the middle of a fleet service area hundreds of miles away from a major city. In the medium term, we will expand to brakes, oil, batteries, etc. becoming an uptime assembly line that keeps fleets on the road 24/7 at a fraction of the maintenance cost per mile we see today.

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication delivered to your home, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).

More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. To date, we've treated 40 patients and have 500 more in waiting.

Zack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor. We are raising money to help patients in waiting, grow our footprint, save lives, and earn venture-level returns for investors."

0,Syndetic,2019,2,New York,W20,Software for data sales,"Companies that sell data need to do two things in addition to building their dataset:
1. Convey the meaning of their data
2. Convey its value

Achieving these two things is surprisingly difficult. The way this is done today is usually by providing a data dictionary that explains the structure of the data (field names, types, maybe a business definition), a sample set that’s relevant to the customer, and a bunch of ad hoc back and forth over email and phone.

Syndetic is a web app that sits on top of your datastore (or you can upload individual datasets as csvs). We scan the data to automatically generate profiling statistics like coverage rates, cardinality, min/max character ranges. We automatically generate sample sets. And we provide a management layer so teams can collaborate on field definitions, data lineage, and any other notes that may be useful to the buyer. The result is a nice looking webpage that we host with your domain (e.g. data.acmeco.com) that can be shared with potential customers, trade partners, or internally - anyone who needs to understand the meaning and value of a specific slice of data. You have full control over what gets published or not to your recipients.

Because we’re connected to the raw data, we can catch things like schema changes and alert you, so your data dictionary never gets out of date. If you want, we can even deliver the data for you to your customers via hosted SFTP, API, or direct database connection."

It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.

Why now?
The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.

Where are we and where are we going?
We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.

Healthcare providers in the US spend $280B a year -- 8% of their revenue -- on medical billing. It’s one of the largest inefficiencies in the American healthcare system. The incumbents in this fragmented space are service companies that throw armies of humans at the problem. Humans may be good at tackling the outrageous complexities of medical billing, but are expensive, slow, and error-prone. We’re charging less and getting providers paid more by using data science, modern workflow automation, and machine learning to rethink medical billing from the ground up.

Today, we charge 5% of the payments we process in exchange for handling everything relating to getting paid: translating doctor’s notes into billable codes, claim submission, appealing denied claims, collecting from patients, and providing sophisticated monitoring & analysis for all of it. This positions us extraordinarily well for our long-term vision of being a complete financial hub for healthcare providers: not only handling billing, but also using billing data to better underwrite loans and AR factoring."

0,Chutney,,2,"Bengaluru, India",W20,Amazon for the next 300m Indians who are coming online now.,"We’re building Amazon for India’s mass market, the new middle class of 300m who are now coming online. Just like Amazon started with books when the US was coming online, we are starting with fresh fruits and vegetables that Indian families buy multiple times every week. 

There are over 450m Indians with access to the internet and smartphones, but only 150m of them buy online. This is because they find eCommerce apps and websites too complex to use. They also find it hard to trust an online business with no physical presence.

With Chutney, customers place their orders on Whatsapp and pick up the next day from a nearby store. All the orders are bulk shipped to the store, bringing down logistics cost.

Chutney is building a network of mom and pop stores spread across the city. Store owners share daily prices of fruits and vegetables with their customers on WhatsApp via the Chutney seller app. The app also has a simple interface for store owners to manage customer orders.

By using WhatsApp we are plugging into the existing customer behavior rather than force-fitting an app or website. Also, by partnering with mom and pop stores, we establish customer trust.

We launched 6 weeks ago in Coimbatore. We are doing over 700 orders a week amounting to $1400, growing at over 40% week on week. We are going after 60m new middle-class households, at 72 orders/year of $3 each, that is a $13b market opportunity for fresh fruits and vegetables alone.

Our vision is to build a chain of Chutney stores throughout the country, expanding across every little neighborhood and serving every need of our customers from fresh fruits and veggies to grocery and FMCG to even electronics and home appliances."

400M millennials in India don't invest because they don't have enough time, knowledge or access to large capital. With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.

We're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.

Potentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. 

More interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships.

We acquire customers at minimal CAC by bank partnerships. We leverage the banks' existing users, by integrating with their mobile app. In turn, we invest into their mutual funds.

Here’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. 

However, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.

We’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.

In terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund. We estimate we can make $12 per user per year, which is 6x our current acquisition cost of $2 per investor."

Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions. There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year. Existing drugs are not effective enough to reverse the trend. Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders – the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure.

Our drug will target mitochondria – the powerhouse of the cell – to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects.

Having been business owners ourselves, we experienced firsthand the struggles of funding a business - from expensive equity options to loans that required personal guarantees.

We went live in Singapore first to validate the product/market fit. We plan to expand across the APAC region..

Our sweet spot is backing repeatable business spend - expenses that leads to increased revenue. Our financing product allows businesses to keep growing with us over time. Over 25% of our loans today are from repeat borrowers.

We created a brand new asset class in Asia - offering flexible repayment options, such as tieing repayment with sales. Business owners LOVE this.

Our automated financial technology platform ingests revenue and alternative data sources that gives us a proprietary edge in understanding the behavior of our borrowers. As we collect continuous data, we are able to offer better financial and technology solutions, while mitigating our downside risk.

Funds are seamlessly deployed via our virtual Jenfi Wallet and MasterCard solution, giving borrowers flexibility to make payments while giving Jenfi real-time tracking of their spend.

----

Carupi is a new app, where consumers can buy and sell cars with the push of a button. It is a managed peer-to-peer marketplace for used cars, very similar to Airbnb, that is reinventing the archaic experience of things such as Craigslist or car dealers through a transparent, easy, fair and safe platform, similar to what Airbnb did to home rentals.

The problem with car selling is that you only have two bad options: (i) if you sell to consumers, you don't know how to take car photos, where or how to properly advertise the car, or perhaps you want to advertise in too many places and managing this is complex and then you feel unsafe when meeting strangers, handling title transfer paperwork and to get paid; or (i) you can sell to dealers or ""instant-cash offer"" startups which give you bad prices since they need high margins to cover their high inventory and fixed costs. 

And car buying is equally bad: (i) you can buy from consumers on classifieds websites and face a terrible experience since meeting strangers is unsafe, there are a lot of scammers in these places not to mention that you may end up buying a lemon or not knowing how to handle paperwork and payment; or (ii) you can buy from dealers who are not well-intentioned and will hide problems because they are negotiating a one-off transaction.

Carupi, like Airbnb, manages the entire end-end transaction from taking photos, managing offers, facilitating test-drives, handling bureaucracy and payment and delivering the car to the buyer - all of that with contractors that are paid per job. 

During the transaction neither buyer nor the seller ever talk to each other or have to worry about safety. And while sellers get the best private-party values on their cars, buyers get fully certified cars for at-home test drives and after purchase.

The founder has previously started the largest consumer-to-business car marketplace in Brazil, leading it to $100M GMV, raising $30M. He is an electrical engineer undergrad with background at McKinsey, Goldman Sachs and MIT (GPA 5.0/5.0)."

- Get a unique link to share the frontend changes for every commit - we'll spin up the environment whenever it's requested, so you don't have to pay to keep them up
- CI runs significantly faster because you can set up your environment (e.g., `docker-compose up -d`) once, and rewind to that snapshot for every following pipeline.
- It's easier to onboard team members because they just have to read the single Layerfile to understand the whole CI process (incl. how to install everything)

Existing online conferences often feel like a one-way webinar where attendees have no impact on the outcome. It might as well be a pre-recorded video. On most platforms, all online events look the same. It’s easy for attendees and speakers to forget what they’re attending. Many customisable platforms that do exist take weeks or months to get your event up and running, we do it within minutes. 

At Zuddl, we’re building out a library of templates for all of the configurable elements of our conferences. You can build off of existing templates and get your event up and running within minutes. By mixing and matching our different event zones, you can reproduce all aspects of physical conferences online. Discussion tables facilitate organic group networking with easy switching between different tables. The expo zone can be used to showcase partner and sponsor booths. The backstage zone helps you run dry runs to ensure smooth event execution. With Zuddl, you can create fully branded conferences with engaging experiences."

We prioritized overcoming this hurdle first, and we were successful! We developed an entirely new way of producing growth factors - which are the key (and most expensive) component of cell culture media. We realized this technology could solve the same problem all lab grown meat companies face.
